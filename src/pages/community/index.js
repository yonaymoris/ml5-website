                The ml5.js community page is dedicated to highlighting artists,
                technologists, makers, activists, thinkers, tinkerers,
                researchers, scientists, designers, students, and
                anyone/everyone who are working in and around machine learning
                in thoughtful ways. Many of these posts not only showcase what
                is possible with ml5.js but also what can be done when applying
                machine learning methodologies and technologies more broadly.
                Special emphasis is given to projects that highlight ethical and
                critical engagement with technology and/or are simply
                delightful.
